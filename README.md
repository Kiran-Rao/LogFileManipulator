# LogFileManipulator (Deprecated) 

An application designed to quickly filter relevant information from extremely large log files.
The app is created in C# and WPF and is built around using regular expressions in an easy to use format. 

The current version supports matching whole lines, removing matched lines and find/replace for single or batch processing.
Future versions will include importing and exporting scripts.

## Deprecated

This project was created before I learned about [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and their multi-cursor support. 
Sublime Text is a much better tool to solve the previously mentioned problem.
